# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be sharing thoughts on frontend development, React, TypeScript, and the tools and techniques I use in my daily work as a frontend developer.

I've been working in frontend development for about 2 years now, primarily with React and TypeScript. Over this time, I've worked on various projects ranging from data visualization applications to user management systems.

## What You Can Expect

I plan to write about:

- React development patterns and best practices
- TypeScript tips and tricks
- Frontend testing strategies
- Performance optimization techniques
- Lessons learned from real projects

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful here!
