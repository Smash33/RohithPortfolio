# Notes on React Development

Some thoughts and observations from building React applications over the past few years. What I've learned about component design, state management, and performance optimization.

## Component Design

One of the most important lessons I've learned is the value of keeping components focused and composable. A good component should:

- Have a single responsibility
- Be easily testable
- Accept props that make it reusable
- Handle its own loading and error states

## State Management

I've worked extensively with Redux Toolkit, and it's been a great experience. The RTK Query integration has made API calls much more manageable:

```javascript
const { data, error, isLoading } = useGetUsersQuery();

if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;

return <UserList users={data} />;
